# MySQL-Covid-19

At this project the scope is dedicated to spreadsheet of Covid-19 and on the territory of Finland especially.

This sphere is interesting for me because I live in this country and it is already one and an half year I face this problem every day. Here there are a lot of interesting insights, which could be explored. For example: how fast the virus was spreading in Finland, how is vaccination influencing on overall situation, etc..
